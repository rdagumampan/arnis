{"name":"Winterfern","tagline":"A simple dependency tracker for .NET applications","body":"###Winterfern\r\n**Winterfern** is a simple dependency tracker for .NET applications using elementary parsing algorithm. My vision is to create full technology stack report on each application covering platforms, components, techniques, and tools... but im very far from it ;)\r\n\r\nBy consistently monitoring the technology stack in our application portfolio, we can plan for component upgrades, monitor 3rd party usage, consolidate component versions, or strategize decommisioning of projects and tools.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, you can:\r\n- track applications built on Visual Studio from 2001 to 2015.\r\n- track target framework versions\r\n- track referenced assemblies from nuget packages and GAC/Referenced Assesmblies folder.\r\n- extendibe to support new trackers and sinks.\r\n\r\n####How to use\r\n    c:\\winterfern /wf:\"<your_workspace_folder>\" /sf:\"<your_desired_csv_file>\" /skf:<skip_these_folders>\r\n\r\nExample (simple):\r\n\r\n\tc:\\winterfern /wf:\"c:\\github\\winterfern\" /sf:\"c:\\stackreport.winterfern.csv\"\r\n\r\nExample (with skip file):\r\n\r\n\tc:\\winterfern /wf:\"c:\\github\\winterfern\" /sf:\"c:\\stackreport.winterfern.csv\" /skf:\"c:\\skip.txt\"\r\n    \r\n    where skip.txt contains\r\n    c:\\winterfern\\bin\\debug\r\n    c:\\winterfern\\packages\r\n\r\n####Trackers\r\nTrackers scans the entire workspace folder to perform analysis of solutions and projects to build dependency tree.\r\nTo create your own tracker, implement IStackTracker interface.\r\n\r\n- **VisualStudioTracker**\r\nScans working folder for solution files and identify the version of Visual Studio used.\r\n- **ReferencedAssembliesTracker**\r\nScans working folder for project files and identify all DLL used in the project. System DLLs are also included.\r\n\r\n####Sinks\r\nSinks writes the tracker's result into specific format or destination.\r\nTo create your own sink, implement IStackReportSink interface.\r\n\r\n- **CsvStackReportSink**\r\nSave the report into CSV file\r\n\r\n####Next Steps\r\n- Support tracking web projects dependencies\r\n\r\n####Limitations\r\nWinterfern is a tool i initially developed for personal use and and no guarantee 100% reliability. This is not runtime dependency tracer. If you need more sophisticated runtime analysis I recommend [Dependency Walker](http://www.dependencywalker.com/), [ILSPy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy), [NDepend](http://www.ndepend.com/) or [Reflector](http://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/reflector/) tools.\r\n\r\n####Future\r\n- Create a sink targetting a Web API in azure and deploy simple site to view the full dependency report\r\n\r\n#### Support or Contact\r\nTwitter: @rdagumampan\r\nEmail: rdagumampan/AT/gmail.com\r\nBlog: [http://rdagumampan.wordpress.com](http://rdagumampan.wordpress.com)","google":"UA-72851429-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
