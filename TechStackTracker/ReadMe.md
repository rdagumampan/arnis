
TechStackTracker
A simple dependency tracker for projects using elementary parsing algorithm.
I use this tool to consolidate the components used by all applications in our entire portfolio.
By consistently monitoring a technology stack, we can perform threat modeling, plan for upgrades or decommisioning of projects and tools.
